# Hardware Testbed and Large-scale Testbed Co-simulation based Hardware in Loop Simulation

## Overview

**H**ardware **T**est**B**ed and **L**arge-scale **T**est**B**ed Co-Simulation (HLTB Co-Sim) is a real-time hybrid EMT-phasor simulation for Hardware in Loop (HIL) Simulation.

## HTB-LTB Co-Simulation Operation Procedure

The LTB part should be started first:

In an Anaconda Terminal (windows start menu), change the path to the working path

```
cd $HOME:\hlcosim\
```

Activate the HLC environment

```
conda activate hlc
```

Open Jupyter Notebook

```
jupyter notebook
```
