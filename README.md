# Hardware Testbed and Large-scale Testbed Co-simulation based Hardware in Loop 

## Overview

**H**ardware **T**est**B**ed and **L**arge-scale **T**est**B**ed Co-Simulation (HLTB Co-Sim) is a hardware based real-time hybrid EMT-phasor simulation. 

## Background

**H**ardware **T**est**B**ed (HTB) is a power electronic-based power system emulators[^1], and **L**arge-scale **T**est**B**ed (LTB) [^2][^3][^4] is a large-scale power system simulation that can be used as virtual grid or digital twin of a real power grid.
